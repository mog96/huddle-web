Human connection matters.

Studies prove human connection is essential to happiness, mental health and thriving community.

Technology today.

Tech keeps us  highly "connected" yet has created a largely impersonal world that has eroded the fabric of real human relationships and community. In an era of polarizing politics, fear of other and fake news propagated through media, human connection matters now more than ever to overcome and dispell the severity of our purported differences.

It's time to forge real human connections and rebuild real-world community.

Meet huddle.

The application that provides strangers  the opportunity to get together (huddle) in public spaces to engage in spontaneous communal activities.
